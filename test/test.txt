sorte is called newe Wine, which hath 
left his sweetnes &#38; gotten clearenesse, but 
yet it is not long since it was made. Ga&#173;
len in his booke of making of medicines, 
seemeth to call all Wine that is not fully 
fiue yeares olde, newe wine, and it that 
is past fiue yeares vntill it hee ten yeare 
olde, wine of middle age, and it that is 
aboue the age of ten yeares, olde wine, 
and Dioscorides writing of the nature 
of Wines in his fifte booke, calleth it 
Wine of middle age, that is more than 
seauen yeare olde, and Plinie writeth,
<pb sig="b2v"/>
not without an error of the scribe (as I 
gesse) that <term lang="la">Falerno media aetas incipit

la a man otherwise wel learned, leauing 
the authoritie of Galen, calleth it newe 
Wine that keepeth still his Mustish and 
sweete taste, and as yet hath gotten no 
sharpenesse, and he calleth that Wine of 
middle age, that is no more sweete, but 
is cleare, and sayth that he and his coun&#173;
trimen take the most notable Wines of 
Fraunce for olde Wines, before they bee 
fullye one yeare olde. And this doth he 
holde <term lang="la">enarrationum medicinalium, 
lib. sexto, enarratione septima.</term> In the

della for saying that wine sixe yeares 
olde was newe wine after Galen, who 
although fayled in exceeding one yeare 
beyond Galens numbring of the yeares 
of new wine, yet he went a great deale 
farther from Galens minde than Mun&#173;
della did. Must when it is made euen of 
ripe grapes, is but hote in the first de&#173;

following. <term lang="la">Vinum est ex fecundo or&#173;

that is, wine (that is to say of midle age) 
is hote in the seconde degree, but it that

I cannot tell, for I cannot giue to euery 
one of these wordes one seuerall vsed 
English word, without circumlocution, 
wherfore seeing that the proper English 
wordes are so harde to be found: and the 
meaning of the words are as little kno&#173;
wen of the most part of all men, I think 
it shall be necessarye to shewe by the au&#173;
thoritie of some old learned writer, what 
these words <term lang="la">adstringens, austerum</term> and 
<term lang="la">acerbum, acer</term> and <term lang="la">acidus</term> doe signifie 
and betoken. If any man say that I nede 
not to take this paine, bicause the great 
and costlye booke, called <term lang="la">Thesaurus 
linguae Romanae &#38; Britannicae</term>, that 
is, the treasure of the Latin and English 
tongue, hath done that thing alreadie: I
<pb sig="d4v"/>
aunswere that I asked counsell of that 
great booke, and in dede as I found great 
plentie both of good Latin wordes, and 
fine maners of speaking, gathered wyth 
great paines, and ordered with no small 
learning and iudgement: but in <expan>the</expan> Eng&#173;
lish, as I found to much plentie of light, 
and new inckhorne termes: so in some 
places I founde such scarcenesse, lacke, 
and want of proper and true Englishe 
names, that the author is faine to giue 
one name to diuerse Latin wordes, for 
when I looked how he englished <term lang="la">Acer</term>, 
he englisheth it thus. Eger, sharpe, tart, 
soure or fell. Lo, here is great plentie of 
wordes, and yet we can not tell what <term lang="la">a&#173;
cer</term> in taste doth properly signifie, and a 
litle after he writeth these wordes, <term lang="la">acer, 
acidus succus, Vitruuius</term>, eger. By this 
booke we may English <term lang="la">lac acidum</term>, eger 
milke. And afterwarde where as of pur&#173;
pose he expo<expan>un</expan>deth what <term lang="la">Acidus</term> betoke&#173;
neth, he englisheth it, eger, soure, sharp, 
and he englisheth <term lang="la">acidula pira</term>, soure 
peares, he englisheth <term lang="la">Acerbum</term>, vnripe, 
soure, displeasant, and <term lang="la">Acerbitas</term>, soure&#173;
<pb sig="d5r"/>
nesse of taste, sharpnesse or grieuousnesse 
of time. He englisheth <term lang="la">Austerus</term>, soure, 
sharpe, vnpleasant, and <term lang="la">gustus austerus</term> 
a rough or soure tast.

Now how shall a man know by this 
booke what difference is betweene, <term lang="la">acer, 
acidus, austerus</term> and <term lang="la">acerbus</term>, when as 
he calleth them all soure, and putteth so 
small difference betweene one and ano&#173;
ther. Surely we haue but small helpe of 
that booke in declaring of these words, &#38; 
many such other, that are much occupied 
in phisicke and philosophy, and in other 
both liberall and mathematical sciences. 
Wherfore I wishe, to the ende that the 
booke may be in dede as it is called: that 
one learned phisition &#38; philosopher like 
vnto Linaker, one olde and learned gr<expan>an</expan>marian like vnto Clemond, and one 
perfite Englishman like vnto Sir Tho&#173;
mas Moore, had the amendment and 
making perfite of this booke commited 
vnto them. But now as Terence sayeth, 
<term lang="la">quoniam hac n<expan>on</expan> successit, alia aggre&#173;
diendum est via</term>. Galen in the first of 
his bookes that he writeth of the powers
<pb sig="d5v"/>
of simple medicines sayth. Cap. 39. If any 
man doe taste quinces or apples, or med&#173;
lers, or mirtels, doubtlesse he shall know 
that there is an other feeling that is mo&#173;
ued vnto vs of these things in <expan>the</expan>  tongue, 
and another of bodies <term lang="la">astringentibus</term>, 
that is, that are onely binding, for those 
things that are binding, appeare to driue 
inwarde that part of vs that they touche 
in al places equally or in like, as pulling, 
stopping, as drawing togither. But <term lang="la">au&#173;
stera</term> seeme to goe downe euen vnto the 
bottome, and to moue a rough and vn&#173;
equal feeling and drying vp and wasting 
all the moisture of feeling bodies. Fur&#173;
thermore when as that bodie which is 
moued vnto our tongue doth mightilye 
drie and draw togither, and maketh it 
rough euen to the bottome, as choke 
peares that are not ripe, and cornelles, 
euerye such is called <term lang="la">acerbum</term>, differing 
from <term lang="la">austero</term> in the excesse of these qua&#173;
lities. That is to say, <term lang="la">austerum</term> in many 
things is like vnto <term lang="la">acerbo</term>, but <term lang="la">acerbum</term> 
is in all those things wherein they are 
something like, much stronger and migh&#173;
<pb sig="d6r"/>
tier than <term lang="la">austerum</term> is: and Galen in an&#173;
other place writeth, that astringent is 
weaker than <term lang="la">acerbum</term> and <term lang="la">austerum</term>, in 
all those properties that they haue anye 
likenesse in. And Galen in <expan>the</expan> .ix. booke <term lang="la">de 
simplicium medicamentorum facul&#173;
tatibus</term>, sayeth that <term lang="la">adstringentia</term> draw 
togither, bind togither, and do make thick 
our substance, and therfore vpon what&#173;
soeuer part of our bodie they be layde 
without, by and by they make it full of 
wrinkles, and draw togither. Further&#173;
more after <expan>the</expan> doctrine of Galen, we may 
perceiue in some kindes of peares, mar&#173;
ked at diuerse times, <term lang="la">gustum acerbum, 
austerum &#38; astringentem</term>. When the 
peares are newly growen, if ye taste of 
them at the first, ye shall perceyue that 
they are harde and drie, and are verye 
rough in taste, and then they are called 
<term lang="la">acerba</term>, but after that they are more than 
halfe ripe, when that hardnesse and dri&#173;
nesse is gone, then become they moyster 
and softer, and are in taste <term lang="la">austera</term>. And 
when they are full ripe, they are <term lang="la">astrin&#173;
gentia</term>, with a sweete taste ioyned ther&#173;
<pb sig="d6v"/>
with. By this discription, I trust wise 
and learned men by taking of some paine 
in reading of olde English writers shall 
come by the knowledge of right and pro&#173;
per English wordes for these .iij. Latin, 
or els at the least I iudge that men shall 
vnderstande what difference is betweene 
<term lang="la">astringens, austerum</term> and <term lang="la">acerbum</term>. In 
the meane time vntill that we may spede 
better, we may english <term lang="la">astringens</term>, binding, <term lang="la">austerum</term>, soure bin&#173;
ding, and <term lang="la">a&#173;
cerbum</term>, rough and binding like choke 
peares. And Galen <term lang="la">lib. 1. simpl. medic. 
facultatibus. cap. 39.</term> and in diuerse o&#173;
ther places maketh an open and plaine 
difference betweene <term lang="la">acre</term> and <term lang="la">acidum</term>, 
contrarie to it that is alleaged of Vitru&#173;
uius, who maketh them both one. For 
Galen sayeth, that <term lang="la">acria</term> are <term lang="la">calida</term>, and 
that <term lang="la">acida</term> are cold.

<term lang="la">Acer</term> may be Englished biting sharp, 
and <term lang="la">acidum</term> may be named soure as sor&#173;
rell, and soure milke, and diuers other 
things. Aetius writeth, that wine that 
is soure with an harrish binding, so that 
it be well smelling withall, hurteth the
<pb sig="d7r"/>
head, but it which is waterishe, neither 
breedeth the headach, neither hurteth the 
sinewes. Galen also sayth that soure bin&#173;
ding wines stoppe flowings, and streng&#173;
then the stomach, and hurt not the head, 
but that they helpe not them that are 
fallen into a swounde.

Wines that are rough and binding in 
taste like vnto choke peares, stop vomi&#173;
tings and flowings of the belly, and they 
coole and drie. Moreouer they goe hardlye 
downe, when as those things that are 
only of a soure taste, go easily downe.

I haue learned by experience (sayeth 
Galen) that all those things that binde, 
and are also soure, are manifestly cold.

Simeon Sethi sayeth, wines that are 
a little and gently binding, &#38; are in color
red, and in substance thin, are good for 
them that are of a good and a meane com&#173;
plexion and temperature. But they are 
of a good complexion and of a mean tem&#173;
perature that are neither to hote nor to 
colde, neither to moyst nor to drie, of the 
which sort I weene we shall finde as few 
at this time almost, as we shalbe able to
<pb sig="d7v"/>
finde citizens of Platoes common welth 
in euery parish of England. And Galen 
a man of more authoritie than Simeon 
Sethi is of, writeth in the booke of good 
and euill iuices, that as fierie red wines, 
for asmuch as they are hote in working, 
by and by fill the heade, euen so those 
wines that are thin and waterishe, and 
doe lightly bind, not only are not vnnoy&#173;
some vnto the head, but also take awaye 
small headaches, and he saith afterward, 
all wines that are binding, are comfort&#173;
able for the stomache, and that such as 
are soure and colde, be of subtill partes, 
but they that are binding, are of grosse 
parts <term lang="la">de simplie. med. facultatib. lib. 
4. cap. 2.</term>

Whatsoeuer things are sweete, cannot 
be colde, therfore sweete wines are of an 
hote complexion: and Dioscorides sayth, 
sweete wines hath grosse partes in it, 
and doth breath out of the bodie more 
hardlye, it filleth the stomache full of 
winde, it troubleth the bellye, and the 
guttes as Must doth, but it maketh not 
a man so sone drunken, but it is most fit
